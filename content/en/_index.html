This is an **example technical documentation site** created using the [**docsy-for-telus**](https://github.com/andrewdhr/docsy-for-telus) Hugo theme. 
**Hugo** is a very popular open-source project used for building static websites in a hassle-free and code-free manner. This example website, 
built in the name of an arbitrary **TELUS Awesome Team**, shows you what your team's documentation website would look like and how it may fit your team's
 documentation needs.

Just to be clear, the **Awesome Team** is not real here at TELUS. But just like them, you can also easily 
own this beautiful and centralized UI for hosting your team's technical and work documents. Developers or not, please simply click the 
**Getting Started** button above to start using this template and follow the set-up guide. In the end, you will find that it is actually very easy to use,
 and you are guaranteed to like your new, clean, and centralized technical documentation site which will be securely hosted 
 on our TELUS GitHub Enterprise Cloud!
